     It's boring, but every single Kibbles call always needs to know what's

     the standard analysis of the <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']</code> and
     <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT'])</code> to handle the necessary
     processing. If the standard processing is not acceptable, then those
     scripts must implement their own processing. They should still try and
     use as much of the <a
     href="/documentation/kibbles/src/lib/accept-processing-lib.php">accept-processing-lib.php</a>
