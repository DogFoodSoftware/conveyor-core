- conveyor-core
  - redo package names to all nest under orgs; no need for subdirs(;
    github's right)
  - redo installation to remove the conveyor runtime? seems like we
    may be able to entirely cover with nix and then do some neat
    tricks when the data structure's don't change. Specifically, if we
    move the development install as another nix version, like
    'conveyor-apache/default.nix' and
    'conveyor-apache/development.nix', then we could install /both/
    and flip back and forth effortlessly.
