For the consultant-entrepreneur, success means steady business at a good
rate. The professionals that reach this point run into a problem. The 'must
do' activities surrounding the core value grow along with the business such
that they are most burdensome exactly when the business is mature.

Not only is there more 'must do' work to be done, but the lost billable time
is worth more than ever. Among the consultants and entrepreneur's I've talked
to non-value add, 'must do' work can consume anywhere from 10%-25% of the raw
time, which translates into between $500-$2,000 in lost opportunity costs per
month. Many feel that overall the cost of context switching and the feeling
of stress from being 'spread thin' makes the perceived cost much higher at one
to five thousand dollars per month.
