    Conveyor combines people, computers, and process to get things done. Like
    a conveyor belt in an assemply line, the Conveyor system manages inputs
    and outputs between different stages, automating much of the process and
    dramatically increasing the productivity of both individuals and
    business. At least, that's the long term goal.

    This section should move. The template uses mustache/HTML. It expects to
    be sandwiched between an optional site header and footer, but should not
    rely on that for navigation. All pages should provide internal navigation.

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Hosts</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A Conveyor Host is a computer set up to enable it to host Conveyor
    services. Hosts may be categorized as 'physical' or 'virtual' as well as
    by function.

  <div class="p">
    Within a Conveyor runtime, an actor is any entity capable of independent
    action<span data-perspective="detailed"> with respect to the
    runtime</span>. An actor may
    be <a href="/documentation/conveyor/ref/Actors#Human-and-Software-Actors">human
    or a software entity</a>. Software actors may also be classified
    as <a href="/documentation/conveyor/ref/Actors#Internal-and-External-Actors">internal

    A <a href="ref/Projects">projects</a> is the primary unit of
    development. A project can be for almost any
    purpose. <a href="ref/Projects#Common-Provisions">Common provisions</a>

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Tasks and Plans</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A 'task' is a unit of work which produces definite and potentiall
    actionable results. A 'task plan', or just 'plan', is the logic which (in
    part) drives task creation.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Work Product</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Work products are the output of projects. Many work proudcts exist
    entirely within the Conveyor universe as documentation or code artifacts
    and such. The final work product may also be a physical thing, like a
    chair or car or a printed book, etc. In this case, the project will track
    or otherwise retain information about these physical products so the
    Conveyor process may continue to work with the items throughout their
    life. This may include tracking serial numbers and attaching them to
    warranties or repair history, etc.

<div id="Tiered-Knowledge" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Tiered Knowledge</div>
  <div class="p">
    'Knowledge' here refers to facts as well as documented process and
    standards and broadly refers to the corpus of everything known or knowable
    within an ecosystem. Of course, the full volume of such knowledge is
    immense, and so we break it down into three tiers.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The first tier consists of the fundamental Conveyor models, the five key
    nouns discussed above and other concepts which define the lexicon and
    bondaries of discourse. This foundational knowledge is fully defined and
    articulated within the Conveyor project.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The second tier of knowledge is captured within Conveyor compliant
    projects which document the high level goals, process, and knowledge
    within a particular ecosystem. This tier is associated with and bound to
    the <span data-todo"Link.">ecosystem manuals</span>
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The final, most detailed tier is captured within ecosystem logic and
    manifested through tasks. This layer is more or less uniquely directly
    actionable.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Viewing the tiers whollistically, we may characterize the first Conveyor
    tier as defining what can be described and how it is described. The
    second, manuals is aimed primarily at humans and provides context for
    actions and logic as well as criteria by which the actionable knowledge
    may be judged. The detailed actionable knowledge is where theory meets
    practice and things actually get done.
