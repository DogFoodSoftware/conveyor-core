    Conveyor is a high level specification dealing with the capture and
    implementation of workflows, especially for the purpose of automating and
    improving efficiencies within a project or organization. Conveyor embeds a
    broad range of business activity within a supporting infrastructure in
    much the same way that an assembly lines emded physical manufacture
    processes within a supporting infrastructure.

    Just as 'the assembly line' was not a single thing, but rather the
    synthesis of many existing ideas with a few technical innovations and a
    lot of trial and error, Conveyor organizes existing technologies and ideas
    into a system derived as much from experience as theory with the goal of
    making the overall process more transparent, testable, and iterable as
    well as opening the process to broader engagement by simplifying
    individual touch points.
