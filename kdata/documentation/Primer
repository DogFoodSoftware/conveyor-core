    Conveyor is a high level specification dealing with the capture and
    implementation of workflows, especially for the purpose of automating and
    improving efficiencies within a project or organization. Conveyor embeds a
    broad range of business activity within a supporting infrastructure in
    much the same way that an assembly lines emded physical manufacture
    processes within a supporting infrastructure.

    Conveyor itself is a foundational technology used <span data-todo="Link
    this line to a page... /dossier/?tag=conveyor-users or something that will
    list known companies and projects.">to build consumer products and
    services.</span> In this sense, Conveyor is like injection-molding. It's
    an important technology used in millions of toys and gadgets, but not
    something most consumers concern themseles with.<span data-todo="Address

    digs into the technical aspects of Conveyor and is addressed primarily to

    Just as 'the assembly line' was not a single thing, but rather the
    synthesis of many existing ideas with a few technical innovations and a
    lot of trial and error, Conveyor organizes existing technologies and ideas
    into a system derived as much from experience as theory with the goal of
    making the overall process more transparent, testable, iterable and
    opening the process to broader engagement by simplifying individual touch
    points.

    An explicit note on usage: when introducing Conveyor specific technical
    terms, the 'Conveyor' association <em>should</em> be explictly stated in
    the first usage in the page, section, or if reasonably distant from the
    last such fully qualified usage. After establishing intent,
    'Conveyor' <em>should</em> be dropped from further references unless an
    explicit distinction needs to be made against usage of the term in another
    sense such as "the Conveyor Ecosystems themselves form a
    'super-ecosystem'". Otherwise, we would refer to the Conveyor Ecosystems
    simply as 'Ecosystems' after the initial introduction.

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Literate Development</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Conveyor incorporates
    <a href="/documentation/literate-development/Primer">Literate
    Development</a> and techniques to construct documentation that is both
    comprehensive and approachable. Conveyor applies these standards to itself
    and <span data-todo="Expand on this point.">Conveyor derived
    products</span>.

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Ecosystems</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A Conveyor Ecosystem is a sovereign virtual space composed of
    infrastructure and <a href="#Actors">Actors</a> collectively contributing
    talents and capabilities towards the achievement of declared
    goals. Ecosystems are most typically organized around legal entities and
    are may be categorized as personal Ecosystems, corporate ecosystems,
    organizational ecosystems, etc. Ecosystems themselves can interactive
    amongst themselves, and you could for instance have a contract developer's
    personal Ecosystem engaged with multiple employer's corporate ecosystems,
    which may themselves be divided into departmental ecosystems for lager
    firms.

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Hosts</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A Conveyor Host is a computer set up to enable it to host Conveyor
    services. Hosts may be categorized as 'physical' or 'virtual' as well as
    by function.

  <div class="subHeader"><span>Actors</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Actors can be categorized as 'autonomous actors' and 'automated
