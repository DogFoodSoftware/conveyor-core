    Conveyor combines people, computers, and process to get things done. Like
    a conveyor belt in an assemply line, the Conveyor system manages inputs
    and outputs between different stages, automating much of the process and
    dramatically increasing the productivity of both individuals and
    business. At least, that's the long term goal.
