    For the consultant-entrepreneur, success means steady business at a good
    hourly rate. Professionals that reach this point run into a problem. The
    cost, especially in time, of overhead grows right along with the business
    and is most burdensome exactly when the business is most successful.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Not only do non-billable demands grow, but the lost billable
    time is worth more than ever. Among the consultants and entrepreneur's
    I've talked to non-value add overhead work can consume anywhere from
    10%-25% of the work week. This can easily translate into many thousands of
    dollars in lost opportunity per year. Especially combined with the feeling
    of being spread thin and pulled in many directions.

  <div class="p">
    Conveyor helps organize and codify much of this non-billable work,
    allowing the consultant entrprenuer to work less and earn more. As a
    secondary benefit, Conveyor rationalizes the flow of billlable work as
    well. The goal is to increase the average return per hour billed by
    20-40%.
