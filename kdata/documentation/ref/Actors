    The capabilities of any given actor are determined by their authorizations

    Every user with access to an environment is a 'human actor' within the
    environment. A 'software actor' is a piece of software which accesses and
    operates within an ecosystem through the same channels which a human actor
    would use.

    The 'internal' or 'external' designation indicates is applied exclusively
    to software agents and indicates whether the software runs within or
    without a particular ecosystem. We do not apply the label to human actors
    as all humans are essentially external to the
    ecosystem.<span class="note">At least given current technology.</span>
