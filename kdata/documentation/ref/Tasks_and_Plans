    A <code>task</code> is a unit of work which produces definite and potentially
    actionable results. A 'task plan', or just 'plan', is the logic which (in
    part) drives task creation. The plan is the driver of any project and
    represents the concrete knowledge of an ecosystem.

    Looking at all the <code>instructions</code> in a full
    blown <code>plan</code> can be daunting and we usually deal with plaans by
    zooming in on a particular area, or even just a single interaction. You
    can think of the <code>plan</code> as one of
    those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose
    Your Own Adventure</a> books.<span class="note">Zane wonders if these
    books taught him coding. Probably not, but good myth.</span> It's
    interesting, because it represents not a single story, but many potential
    stories. In the same way, a <code>plan</code> lays out the kind of things
    a project may do.


Plan cluster: divide plans by project. An ecosystem is created by selecting a
    number of base level projects, sufficient to keep things self contained.


    Each <code>instruction</code> is like a page in that. Writing a good plan
    is very much like writing a good
    story.<span class="note">The <code>plan</code> is not the story itself,
    but rather describes many potential stories.</span>

    A Conveyor environment is at any one point in time, conceptually the
    composition of project snapshots. We implement this idea very directly by
    implementing subscriptions as nothing more than a git
    URL.<span data-perspective="detailed"> Though it hasn't been implement in
    with the standard implementation, the design is meant to add support for
    any versioning system supporting URLs and specific snapshots and/or
    branches could be quickly implemented.

    However, we intentionally want to push this idea of using plain old git,
    combined with specific branch management and deployment strategies. With a
    few small tweaks, we can cover all the features we need with nothing but
    standard git. It's not something that will surface for most users, but
    the technical or curious, the good news and a nice feature about Conveyor
    is that you can really manage your deployments quite effectively, with the
    ability to roll back, isolate changes for testing, and ensure auditable
    processes all by just using git&mdash;which isn't the simplest application
    in the world, but is just about no more complex than really necessary.
