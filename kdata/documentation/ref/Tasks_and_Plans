    Here's the basic idea: <code>plans</code> tell us how to both react to
    input and move forward towards goals. 
    <code>Plan</code> <code>instructions</code> (non-exclusively)
    generate <code>tasks</code>. The <code>task</code> is a unit of work which
    produces definite results which the, for which the system can
    check. Satisfying a <code>task</code> involves changes to the system,
    which trigger new <code>instructions</code>, and so on and so on.

  <div class="p">
    Notice that the <code>instruction</code> and the <code>task</code> it
    creates are symetric. The <code>instruction</code> is triggered by the
    empty name, and the <code>task</code> is satisfied by a non-empty
    name.<span data-perspective="future"> In the current implementation, this
    relationship may be expressed, but is not technically necessary. In future
    versions, we may modify the design such that <code>task</code>
    satisfaction is essentially tied to the <code>instruction</code>
    trigger.</span> This is generally how the system is designed to work. A
    situation is "noticed" by an <code>instruction</code>, which generates
    the <code>task</code> to remedy or advance the state.

  <div class="detailed implementation operations">
  <div class="subHeader"><span><code>Instructions</code> are Only for <code>Tasks</code></span></div>
  <div class="p">
    The <code>instruction</code>/<code>task</code> system is certainly capable
    of asynchronous message passing to automated agents and such, and forms
    the basis of many interesting systems. This use falls within the design
    scope.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    One could also conceive of implementing new technical features, like an
    audit system or, if we allowed pre-state change <code>instructions</code>,
    you could do tie authorizations into the system. We're intentionally
    trying to keep things simple here. By the time an <code>instruction</code>
    is executed, the system state may have changed, and so long
    as <code>instructions</code> deal with <code>tasks</code>, that's fine. If
    the <code>instruction</code>/<code>task</code> system were deputized for
    other purposes, those other uses would start to make demands on the system
    and push the system towards greater complication.
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span><code>Instructions</code> are Reactionary</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Instructions are executed after a valid change in state. A call that
    results in a FORBIDDEN or fails due to server error will never directly
    trigger an <code>instruction</code> because these calls cannot result in
    valid state changes.<span class="note">The term 'valid state change' is
    used here to mean a change it data&mdash;or state&mdash;which is 'valid as
    designed'. Neither FORBIDDEN nor failed requests should never result in
    state change; because of bugs or hardware failures, they may of course
    result in state change, but there's nothing we can do about that and we do
    our best to ignore it. Note there is one exception where rejected and
    failed calls may trigger instructions: the logs themselves may be surfaced
    as a resource, and <code>instructions</code> would be written about the
    logs. This is why we say 'never result in <em>direct</em> change', as we
    consider the case mentioned here to be very much indirect.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span><code>Instructions</code> are Sloppy</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A big reason why we say 
  </div>



    Each <code>instruction</code> remembers whatever is important about the
    universe, and is able to react to changes at any point. When a resource
    changes,<span class="note">Recall that when any item within a resource
    changes, the resource is said to change as well.</span> we proactively
    ping all known instructions associated with the
    resource.<span class="note">These are the instructions tracked in the
    resource item itself, with <code>resources</code> tracked
    as <code>resource</code> items
    (including <code>/resources/resources</code>).</span> However, these
    alerts may fail or be incomplete, which is fine, because the instruction
    is able to tell at any point whether the resource has changed. The item
    will actually be locked against further changes until
    requried <code>instructions</code> are
    executed. Thus, the actual decision is always lazy, and asynchronous,
    though we can initiate the lazy check with a poke.

    Each <code>instruction</code> is like a page in that. Writing a good plan
    is very much like writing a good
    story.<span class="note">The <code>plan</code> is not the story itself,
    but rather describes many potential stories.</span>

  <div class="p">
    <code>Instructions</code> are the end product of planning out and
    capturing institution process and knowledge. Looking at all
    the <code>instructions</code> and considering all the
    potential <code>tasks</code> in a full blown <code>plan</code> can be
    daunting.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>User Stories</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Each <code>instruction</code> <em>should</em> document it's semantic
    purpose and ground itself fully it's it's own raison d'être, which should
    most often ground itself in a user story. This should not be taken to mean
    that a formal user story must procede creation of an instruction, but
    rather that mature <code>instructions</code> are expected to be able to
    explain themselves.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    For larger projects, a more formal connection between instructions and
    user stories may be useful. Though the relation may not be 1-1, user
    stories are a useful lens for understanding, implementing, and
    verifying <code>instructions</code>.

    Let's look at a few examples:

    Base Level Audits
    - trigger: 15th day of quarter
    - result: creates new task to manually audit that all books have a
    quarterly audit instruction scheduled

    Setup Accounting
    - trigger event: PUT /books
    - result: creates new task to create all new accounts

    - trigger event: PUT /books
    - result: creates new instruction to review /books/{new ID} in one
    quarter-annual.*(The DELETE action automatically clears any instructions
    bound to the item. Asynchronous instructions should delete themselves when
    'Item not found or deleted' is returned.)

     - trigger event: put /accounts
     - result: create task to verify required information positively attested
     by qualified operator.

     NOTE: I think we can get rid of the 'task chain' above. Maybe we talk
     about general 'user case' narratives as a good starting point for task
     implementation.

    A Conveyor environment is at any one point in time, conceptually the

    However, we intentionally want to push this idea of using plain old git,
    combined with specific branch management and deployment strategies. With a
    few small tweaks, we can cover all the features we need with nothing but
    standard git. It's not something that will surface for most users, but
    the technical or curious, the good news and a nice feature about Conveyor
    is that you can really manage your deployments quite effectively, with the
    ability to roll back, isolate changes for testing, and ensure auditable
    processes all by just using git&mdash;which isn't the simplest application
    in the world, but is just about no more complex than really necessary.
