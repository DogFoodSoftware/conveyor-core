    Notice that the <code>instruction</code> and the <code>task</code> it

    name.<span data-perspective="future"> In the current implementation, this
    relationship may be expressed, but is not technically necessary. In future
    versions, we may modify the design such that <code>task</code>
    satisfaction is essentially tied to the <code>instruction</code>
    trigger.</span> This is generally how the system is designed to work. A
    situation is "noticed" by an <code>instruction</code>, which generates
    the <code>task</code> to remedy or advance the state.

  <div class="subHeader"><span><code>Instructions</code> are Only for <code>Tasks</code></span></div>
  <div class="p">
    The <code>instruction</code>/<code>task</code> system is certainly capable
    of asynchronous message passing to automated agents and such, and forms
    the basis of many interesting systems. This use falls within the design
    scope.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    One simple idea is to use <code>instructions</code> to implement automatic
    action, such as sending a text message (via REST call) when we see the
    error rates above a certain threshold. In the current system, we are
    limited to tasking an actor to look into it.<span class="note">There's
    nothing to stop <code>tasks</code> from supporting text messaging, which
    would be our suggested approach to this feature.</span>  But this isn't
    straightforward because <code>tasks</code> are part of how we make sure
    someone takes responsibilities for issues. The user has to acknowledge
    a <code>task</code>, but not a text message, so now we have to think a lot
    more abet the implications of instructions because we've removed the
    guaranteed involvement of the intelligent actor in resolving the situation
    that triggered the <code>instruction</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    With many "other ways" to use instructions, you run into problems
    regarding guaranteed delivery, the possibility of state change between
    trigger and resolution, etc. It's great to automate stuff, we just don't
    want to do it through the <code>instruction</code>/<code>task</code>
    system.

  <div id="Instructions-are-Reactions-to-Valid-Changes"
  class="subHeader"><span><code>Instructions</code> are Reactions to Valid
  Changes</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Instructions are executed after a valid change in state. A call that
    results in a FORBIDDEN or fails due to server error will never directly
    trigger an <code>instruction</code> because these calls cannot result in
    valid state changes.<span class="note">The term 'valid state change' is
    used here to mean a change in data&mdash;or state&mdash;which is 'valid as
    designed'. Neither FORBIDDEN nor failed requests should ever result in
    state change. Due to bugs or hardware failures, they may of course result
    in state change, but that state change is considered invalid with respect
    to the design. Rejected or failed update a logging or audit resource,
    which itself may trigger instructions; e.g., task an admin to look into
    the logs whenever there's an error reported. This is why we say 'never
    result in <em>direct</em> change', as we consider the case mentioned here
    to be very much indirect.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span><code>Instructions</code> Verify the Human Scale</div>
  <div class="p">
    While <a href="#Instructions-are-Reactions-to-Valid-Changes"><code>instructions</code>
    are recations to valid changes</a>, <code>instructions</code> are
    fundamentally encoded knowledge. Our example instruction from above
    encodes the idea that the ecosystem should have a name. The instruction
    can be run at any time, and an ecosystem is constantly running through
    it's set of instructions to see what needs to be done.
  </div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="detailed implementation operations">
    You may think this sounds innefficient, and from the standpoint of
    'minimizing REST calls', it certainly is. You might check an instruction
    hundreds of time before detecting a change. You could therefore think it
    reasonable to trigger instructions, like event handlers, and avoid all the
    unecessary checks. The big problem here is that because we don't assume
    all <code>instructions</code> effecting a system to be on the same
    ecosystem, let alone the same host, it would be very costly to guarantee
    all <code>instructions</code> get the message regarding the change in a
    timely fashion. This would make instructions more complex, because they
    now need to deal with late alerts. As is, the idea would be that if the
    ecosystem name were deleted, and then immediately re-entered, the 'ensure
    ecosystem has a name' <code>instruction</code> mightnever be triggered,
    but so what? It's fine for instructions, so long as you remember it's not
    an event processing framework. It's more like constant unit tests fro the
    business.

    <code>Instructions</code> are the end product of planning out and
    capturing institution process and knowledge. Looking at all
    the <code>instructions</code> and considering all the
    potential <code>tasks</code> in a full blown <code>plan</code> can be
    daunting.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>User Stories</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Each <code>instruction</code> <em>should</em> document it's semantic
    purpose and ground itself fully it's it's own raison d'être, which should
    most often ground itself in a user story. This should not be taken to mean
    that a formal user story must procede creation of an instruction, but
    rather that mature <code>instructions</code> are expected to be able to
    explain themselves.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    For larger projects, a more formal connection between instructions and
    user stories may be useful. Though the relation may not be 1-1, user
    stories are a useful lens for understanding, implementing, and
    verifying <code>instructions</code>.

    Let's look at a few examples:

    Base Level Audits
    - trigger: 15th day of quarter
    - result: creates new task to manually audit that all books have a
    quarterly audit instruction scheduled

    Setup Accounting
    - trigger event: PUT /books
    - result: creates new task to create all new accounts

    - trigger event: PUT /books
    - result: creates new instruction to review /books/{new ID} in one
    quarter-annual.*(The DELETE action automatically clears any instructions
    bound to the item. Asynchronous instructions should delete themselves when
    'Item not found or deleted' is returned.)

     - trigger event: put /accounts
     - result: create task to verify required information positively attested

     NOTE: I think we can get rid of the 'task chain' above. Maybe we talk
     about general 'user case' narratives as a good starting point for task
