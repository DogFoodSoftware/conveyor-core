    Every task genarted in a Conveyor project could potentially be executed by
    an employee, a contractor, or some third party
    service.<span class="note">1.0 will certainly add the idea of an automated
    'agent' to this list. An idea which may be mentioned or alluded to
    elswhere, but which has not yet been fully developed.</span> The
    result&mdash;by design&mdash;is a large potential pool of solution
    providers. Here we describe three basic talent options: employee, 'hired
    guns', and 'service providers'.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Employees</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Employees work for the company. Their work products belong to the
    company. The empployer is responsible for providing the employee with
    everything needed to accomplish a task. The relationship between employer
    and employee is relatively close and this is generally the least liquid
    relationship, though in the US at least, shedding and hiring employees is
    not particularly onerous. Employees make sense for tasks involving a
    business' core competency and other areas where work is steady and
    predictable. Employees are also important as investments.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Hired Guns</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Hired guns are typically contractors, though some legal employees may act
    essentially as hired guns. There is relatively little investment on either
    side of the employer-employee relationship. The employee is typically
    responsible for provding all or some of the necessary task
    infrastructure. The employee generally owns work product outright, but
    details may vary and certain work products&mdash;especially
    graphics&mdash; may be subject to different default treatment. The
    employee has less responsibility and less input into task
    fulfillment. Hired guns are generally regarded as cheaper, though this is
    not universal and the most competent technical professionals often prefer
    to act as hired guns, and compensation generally breaks down into average
    and elite. Employers will want to consider elite guns for the most
    critical pieces of work (which may or may not overlap with 'core
    competency').
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Service Providers</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    The service provider relationship is the most distant. The service
    provider fulfills a relatively narrow contract.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Certified Solutionts</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Certification is a technique usedmost often in the hired gun and service
    provider markets to mediate the tension between employees who "just want
    someone who can do it" and a wide market of diverse capabilities. Rather
    that evaluating candidates on individual merits, the employer relies on a
    known certifier.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The public may be a certifier... reviews and such.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    You pay more for certification. Good certification in low overhead, such
    that the price increase is small and easily offset by risk reduction.
