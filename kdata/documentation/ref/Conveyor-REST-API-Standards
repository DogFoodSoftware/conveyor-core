The Conveyor data management recommendations are normative and not required. 

Each essentially stores a single type of data. The typing is primarily
semantic and addresses a human level view of the system. The
<code>/people</code> and <code>/files</code> resources are more or less
self-explanatory. While there are technical resources, like
<code>/authorizations</code>, whose exact nature may not be famililar to the
average user, the basic idea is more or less appearent.

A resource may optionally define data requirements, which vets all new data as
well as modifications to determine whether or not the data is correct.

Any user can make any number of changes at any time because data is always
changed on an (effectively) systemwide branch. The changes may or may not be
accepted onto master. Though subject to legal restrictions, there is always
the technical possibility of forking data at any point, keeping the original
data unchanged, and also allowing the fork owner to make all the changes they
want to the same source data set.

With proper authorizations, a user may preemptively lock all merges, ensuring
their own work, no matter how long running, can be made, while still allolwing
other users to continue to make changes in their own forks. (Of course, there
are usability limits on this kind of situation and in some systems, the
feature might be very limited or the lock times relatively short while on
others, essentially indefinite lock times would be relatively common.)
