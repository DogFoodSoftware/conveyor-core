    A project is the primary unit of development. Beyond that, a project can
    be for almost any purpose and
    project <a href="#Provisions-and-Dependencies">provisionsn and
    dependencies</a> are essentially arbitary. All Conveyor projects, however, adhere to a
    high <a href="#Project-Documentation">standard of documentation</a> and
    there are some <a href="Common-Provisions">common categories</a> worth
    discussing directly.

    While not exhaustive, most provisions can be placed into one of five
    categories:
    <ul>
      <li>a stack service,</li>
      <li>REST services,</li>
      <li>a website,</li>
      <li>encoded knowledge / process, or</li>
      <li>library or support provisions.</li>
    </ul>
    In general, a project will provide a small number&mdash;between one and
    four say&mdash;of primary provisions, sometimes with a few secondary
    libraries or such. 
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Dependencies in Conveyor are actually quite simple and are expressed at
    the project level. Unlike more complex systems like rpm and deps, Conveyor
    dependencies are not self-verifying in any way. When composing packages
    for a runtime system, the author verifies the choices and creates the
    recipe themselves. Conveyor merely installs the projects requested.

    Conveyor does not prescribe what a package can or can't provide, though we
    do define five common provision types: stack services, REST services, a
    website, encoded knowledge / process, and library / support
    provisions. Here, we give a quick rundown of these common provisions.

    TODO: this section is way too long. This shouldbe a paragraph or two at
    most.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    With a vanilla git sever&mdash;where repositorys are just directories on
    some host&mdash;it is permissible to layout the projects in the same
    manner as a <a href="#Runtime-Projects">runtime project
    layout</a>. However, we want to Conveyor projects to be compatible with
    GitHub, which is rather more limited in it's layout options, and hence
    define an alternative repository layout.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Conveyor itself does not enforce any particular GitHub naming
    scheme. The <code>&lt;project&gt;/conf/conveyor-conf.sh</code> file
    specifies the runtime loctaion of the project (which is more tightly
    regulated), and there is no hard connection between the two
    names. However, in order to make it easier for humans to find projects on
    GitHub, we recommend the following conventions.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Specifically, whereas a basic filesystem allows arbitrary nesting, GitHub
    allows only a single level of file grouping under an 'Organization'. The
    first level domain folder in the runtime should be mapped to a GitHub
    Organization. The GitHub Organizations should be related to the domain
    name, but is not usually itself a domain name. For instance, the Conveyor
    core packages are installed under <code>dogfoodsoftware.com</code> in a
    runtime environment, while the GitHub Organization is 'DogFoodSoftware'.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The (potentially) nested project structure from the runtime layout is
    necessarily flattened. In order to facilitate organization, containing
    folders are generally pre-pennded to the project
    name. E.g. the runtime <code>~/dogfoodsoftware.com/conveyor/core</code>
    becomes <code>/DogFoodSoftware/conveyor-core.git</code> on GitHub.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Developers managing many projects, or wishing to separate key projects
    into their own groups, may break up the GitHub projects further by
    introducing additional 'Organizations', which in this case are used more
    as groups. These groups should, but are not required, to reflect the
    organization name. E.g., in the future, we expect to migrate the Dog Food
    Software jQuery projects to 'DFS-jQuery'
