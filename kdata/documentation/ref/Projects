    A project is the primary unit of development. A project can be for almost
    any purpose and project <a href="#Provisions-and-Dependencies">provisionsn
    and dependencies</a> are essentially arbitary. All Conveyor projects,
    however, adhere to a high <a href="#Project-Documentation">standard of

    categories</a> worth discussing directly.

  <div class="blurbTitle">Provisions and Dependencies</div>
  <div class="p">
    While not exhaustive, most provisions can be placed into one of five
    categories:
    <ul>
      <li>a stack service,</li>
      <li>REST services,</li>
      <li>a website,</li>
      <li>encoded knowledge / process, or</li>
      <li>library or support provisions.</li>
    </ul>
    In general, a project will provide a small number&mdash;between one and
    four say&mdash;of primary provisions, sometimes with a few secondary
    libraries or such. 
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Dependencies in Conveyor are actually quite simple and are expressed at
    the project level. Unlike more complex systems like rpm and deps, Conveyor
    dependencies are not self-verifying in any way. When composing packages
    for a runtime system, the author verifies the choices and creates the
    recipe themselves. Conveyor merely installs the projects requested.
  </div>
  <div id="Common-Provisions" class="subHeader"><span>Common
  Provisions</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Conveyor does not prescribe what a package can or can't provide, though we
    do define five common provision types: stack services, REST resource, a
    website, encoded knowledge / process, and library / support
    provisions. Here, we give a quick rundown of these common provisions.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <em>Stack services</em> are 'low level' services provided by third party
    binaries and services. The Apache web server, apache-httpd, and Postgres
    database service are typical examples. Conveyor projects provide these
    services by wrapping the installation and management of the services in
    Conveyor installation protocol and REST services.
  </div>
  <div id="REST-resources" class="p">
    <em>REST resources</em> are the bread and butter of Conveyor. REST
    resources show up most visibly as the first element in the URL path such
    as <code>/documentation</code> and <code>/projects</code>. Projects
    provide these resources by implementing and configuring handlers for the
    resource type.
  </div>
  <div id="Websites" class="p">
    <em>Websites</em> is exactly what it says. A website. Typically, an
    organization will maintain one or more websites, each bound to a
    particular domain name. Websites are the entry point for all user
    activity. They define the style, content, and applications available in
    the given domain.
  </div>
  <div id="Encoded-knowledge" class="p">
    <em>Encoded knowledge</em> represents knowledge and process which may be
    referenced and processed through Conveyor services and/or by human
    readers. The encoding is typically organized into 'manuals' published by
    organization. For instance, an organization may create an operations
    manual for administrators and a developers manual encoding development
    process.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <em>Libraries</em> and other support provisions define common code and
    content to be referenced and used by other projects /
    provisions. Internal libraries not intended for use outside of a
    particular project are generally not declared as provisions. Declared
    libraries are intendend for 'public' consumption. These may be included as
    secondary provisions in support of other provisions, or&mdash;with certain
    important or key libraries&mdash;they may be distributed as the primary
    provision themselves.

<div id="Project-Documentation" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Project Documentation</div>
  <div class="p">
    Conveyor project documentation standards require that a project:
    <ul>
      <li>address the potential audience clearly and directly through the use
	of <a href="/documentation/kwiki/Primer#Perspectives">documentation
	perspectives</a>,</li>
      <li>include clear installation instructions,</li>

  <div class="blurbTitle">Project Repositories</div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Extra-Repo Layout</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    When possible, git repositories themselves should be laid out along the
    same lines as the runtime layout, with a root direcotry containing
    organization domains, which in turn contain projects or project
    groups.<span data-perspective="future"> The upcoming Conveyor managed git
    host does exactly this.</span> As many if not most projects utilize
    GitHub&mdash;which does not allow general groups&mdash;there is no general
    requirement.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Each Conveyor project must declare it's runtime location
    in <code>conf/conveyor-conf.sh</code>, and the location of the repository
    is functionally irrelevant. If not laying out the repositories to mirror
    the runtime locations, we reccomend the following conventions:
    <ul>
      <li>For projects primarily 'wrapping' third party software, repository
	names should begin with <code>_third-party-</code>.</li>
      <li>For projects primarily providing REST resource and core Conveyor
	libraries, repository names should begin
	with <code>conveyor-</code>.</li>
      <li>For projects primarily providing websites, repository names should
	begin with the domain of the website with the
	suffix <code>-website</code>.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="Default-Branch" class="subHeader"><span>Default Branch</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Functionally most repos are either 'pure repos', used as the 'origin'
    repository for local runtime or development checkouts, or the repo is a
    local runtime or development checkout. The 'canonical project repository'
    is the repository designated by the project owners/managers as where the
    canonical copy of the project resides. Any potential checkout source and
    especially the canonical repositories should maintain the latest
    production branch as the default checkout branch.

  <div class="blurbTitle">Additional Project Properties</div>
  <div class="p">
    Every bit in under Conveyor control lives within a single project. This
    means every file, image, and artificat has one and only one home. Projects
    may reference artifacts through symbolic links.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Projects may make use of 'distro services' and libraries. These are
    installed by the project installation process, but are not otherwise
    managed by the projects per se. It is possible (and planned) to offer
    distribution / external service management services as provisions of
    projects in the future.

  <div id="Standard-Installation" class="subHeader"><span>Standard
  Installation</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    The standard installation clones a git repository and checks out the the indicated
    or <a href="#Default-Branch">default</a> branch as the current working
    copy. At this time,
    the <a href="#Custom-Installation">custom <code>install</code>
    script</a>, if any is found, is executed. At this point, the only change
    to the Conveyor runtime is that the project is now installed and new
    services and data may be available for activation or import.
  </div>
  <div id="Custom-Installation" class="subHeader"><span>Custom Installation</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Many projects are installed by a standard process which does not require
    project specific installation logic. This is specifically true of most
    projects consisting entirely of static data and dynamically run
    scripts. Some commen reasons for including an <code>install</code> file
    are the need:
    <ul>
      <li>to build binaries,</li>
      <li>for project specific configuration of supporting services, and</li>
      <li>to initialize database constructs.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Any project may include an <code>install</code> script in the root of the
    project repository (aka, project home directory). This script will be run
    immediately after the project is checked out/copied to runtime playground.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The script itself may use any supported language. In any case, we
    recommend use of
    the <a href="/documentation/ref/code-templates/conveyor-install.sh"><code>conveyor-install.sh</code></a>
    template as a starting point. All scripts must comply with the following
    requiremens:
    <ul id="install-script-requirements">
      <li>Executing the script for an appearently installed project must
	result in no file system changes, a warning to the user, and exit code
	<code>11</code>.</li>
      <li>The script may optionally support 'standalone' installation, in
	which case it will checkout the project first, and then pass control
	to the checked out install script. If a non-standalone script is
	executed outside the context of an (apparent) working copy, then
	it <em>must</em> make no file system changes, emit a warning a to the
	user, and exit with code <code>12</code>.</li>
      <li>Any non-recoverable error <em>must</em> result in an exit code
	of <code>1</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    Any user warnings or errors should, whenever possible, explain why the
    warning is happening and give advice on how to correct or otherwise proceed.
