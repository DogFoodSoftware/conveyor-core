    Authorized users may access Conveyor environments through the
    as <a href="/conveyor-environments"><code>/conveyor-enviroment</code>
    resource</a> from within an active Conveyor enviroment and manage the
    local and foreign environments through as one would with any other
    resource through standard
    HTTP <a href="/documentation/conveyor/lexicon/service-request">service
    requests</a>. The Conveyor environment itself is also a stack component
    and host service and supports standard bash-based script management as
    well.

    Of course, as the environment is also the primary unit of operation, the
    environment is a bit special since you have to have an active, running
    environment in order to do 'everything else'. Luckily, starting an
    environment is as easy as running
    the <code>~/playground/conveyor/bin/service-start</code> script.

    Under (the very thin) covers, the environment service simply passes
    through commands to the underlying host services required for the
    environment. The specific host services vary from environment to
    environment, but must, at a minumum, include a web server.

    One can view an environment as a collection of specific project versions,
    checked out, built, and running. The specific versions are specified in
    the project subscription. When an environment is updated, all services are
    temporarily shut down (making the environment inactive), the environment
    subscription is updated, any updated entries in the subscription file are
    updated, any new update scripts are run, and then all services are
    restarted.  This process can be initiated via the web service (TODO: how?)
    or via the <code>~/playground/conveyor/bin/sevice-update</code> script.

    An environment may generally be in one of three 'readiness states':
    <ul>
      <li><code>UNAVAILABLE</code>: meaning the core web server is not running
      or web services are otherwise unavailable,</li>
      <li><code>PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE</code>: meaning core web services are
      available, but subscribed services specific to the particular
      environment may not be available,</li>
      <li><code>AVAILABLE<code>: meaning core web services and all subscribed
      services are available.</li>
    </ul>
    An <code>UNAVAILABLE</code> envorironment cannot be reached through normal
    means (REST-y HTTP web services). A <code>PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE</code>
    environment can be reached, but may not be prepared to to successfuly
    respond to all service requests. In this state, certain core service
    requests&mdash;such as requests to the
    for <code>/conveyor-environment</code> resource&mdash;should function
    properly. All other requests are safe, in the sense that
    requests<span data-prespective="detailed operations"> (in the absence of
    bugs)</span> pose no threat to system or data integrity, though a request
    may result in an HTTP <code>503 Service Unavailable</code> response.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    An <code>AVAILABLE</code> system is one in which all projects source code is
    up-to-date with regards to the environment subscription and in which all
    project run times are built and operational. An <code>AVAILABLE</code>
    system services should<span data-perspective="detailed"> (in the absence
    of bugs)</span> match the services advertised in the subscription file.

    In the 0.1 version, an environment is tied to a host. In future versions,
    environments will transcend individual hosts, supportinga and potentially
    manifesting in multi-host arrangements. For the time being, however,
    for each Conveyor environment, there is a singel host.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Thus, for any given environment hosted on a particular host, the
    individual project descriptions are determined as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>The configuration
      in <code>~/playground/conveyor/runnable/standard-conveyor-environment.conf</code> <!--  -->
      is processed.</li>
      <li>If
      present, <code>~/playground/conveyor/data/local-convyeor-environment.conf</code>
      is processed, and any values therein will override those in the standard
      Conveyor environment configuration file.
    </ul>
    The resultiing effective environment configuartion specifies specific
    versions of each project to which to subscribe to.
