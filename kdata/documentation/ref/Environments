    Authorized users may access Conveyor environments through the
    as <a href="/conveyor-environments"><code>/conveyor-enviroment</code>
    resource</a> from within an active Conveyor enviroment and manage the
    local and foreign environments through as one would with any other
    resource through standard
    HTTP <a href="/documentation/conveyor/lexicon/service-request">service
    requests</a>. The Conveyor environment itself is also a stack component
    and host service and supports standard bash-based script management as
    well.

    Of course, as the environment is also the primary unit of operation, the
    environment is a bit special since you have to have an active, running
    environment in order to do 'everything else'. Luckily, starting an
    environment is as easy as running
    the <code>~/playground/conveyor/bin/service-start</code> script.

  <div class="p" data-perspective="operations">
    Under (the very thin) covers, the environment service simply passes
    through commands to the underlying host services required for the
    environment. The specific host services vary from environment to
    environment, but must, at a minumum, include a web server.
