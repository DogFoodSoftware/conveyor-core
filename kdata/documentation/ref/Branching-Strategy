    Conveyor defines a standard branching strategy intended to move features
    from initial implementation towards release. The strategy is implemented
    by the <a href="TODO">Git-Convey</a> git extension, and for day-to-day
    usage, most developers can and should work entirely within the Git-Convey
    tool.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="future" class="p">
    In future Conveyor versions, the developer will interact through the
    task interface to create and manage branches and many of these details
    will hidden in the day-to-day interactions. Basic Conveyor assessments
    will still cover the branching strategy, which developers should
    understand.

<div id="Permanent-Branches" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Permanent Branches</div>
  <div class="p">
    There are two permanent branches: <code>master</code>
    and <code>testing</code>. The
    <code>master</code> branch represents the latest collective best effort by
    development. The <code>master</code> branch <em>should</em> always be
    runnable and pass all extant tests. In practice, people make mistakes and
    at any given point in time <code>master</code> may contain errors,
    especially as relates to new features.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Enter <code>testing</code>. This is where code goes to mature. At the
    beginning of the <a href="#Release-Cycle">release cycle</a>, the
    accumulated changes on <code>master</code> are promoted
    to <code>testing</code>, where the focus is exclusively on stabilization
    and bug fixes.
  </div>

<div id="Release-Branches" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Release Branches</div>
  <div class="p">
    At the end of the <a href="#Release-Cycle">release cycle</a>, the
    stabalized, relatively bug-free code on <code>testing</code> is promoted
    to a <code>release-*</code> branch. Release branches are where 'production
    ready' code lives. The release branches are long lived&mdash;even
    indefinitely so&mdash;but not permanent in that each release may be
    sunsetted someday. Many release branches have a built in sunset dates.
  </div>
</div><!-- #Release-Branches.blurbSummary -->
<div id="Release-Cycle" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Release Cycle</div>
  <div class="p">
    The branching strategy is integrated with a concrete release cycle which
    envisions the regular flow of new features from <code>master</code>
    to <code>testing</code> to <code>release-*</code> branches. A release
    cycle is said to begin when the accumulated updates on <code>master</code>
    are promoted to <code>testing</code> and end when
    the <code>release-*</code> branch is cut from <code>testing</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Within this framework, projects are free to define their own release
    schedule and strategy. Some projects may release at certain milestones,
    others may release on a periodic schedule.
  </div>

<div id="Task-Branches" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Task Branches</div>
  <div class="p">
    Every change in the system is first introduced in a task branch. There are
    three variations:
    <ul>
      <li><code>task-*</code> branches are cut from <code>master</code> and
      are most typically associated with new features.</li>
      <li><code>bugfix-*</code> branches are cut from <code>testing</code> and
      always represent bug fixes.</li>
      <li><code>hotfix-*</code> branches are cut from a <code>release-*</code>
      branch and alays represent bug fixes.</li>
    </ul>
    To be clear, these are three variations of task
    branches. A <code>task-*</code> branch is (hopefully) the most common by
    far.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Note that the task branch prefix is determined by the source branch and
    not by the purpose per-se. Bugs may be fixed on <code>master</code> for
    various reasons&mdash;the fix itself may be disruptive, or simply
    relatively low value. Such changes would still be isolated on
    a <code>task-*</code> branch.
  </div>
</div><!-- #Task-Branches.blurbSummary -->
<div id="Actions" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Actions</div>
  <div class="p">
    Every action which would introduce a new commit can be isolated to one of
    six actions:
    <ul>
      <li><code>git convey update</code>: brings the local repository
      up-to-date with the remote <code>origin</code>.</li>
      <li><code>git convey start &lt;task|bugfix|hotfix&gt; &lt;task
      ID&gt;</code>: used to create a new branch where changes can be
      isoloted.</li>
      <li><code>git convey commit ...</code>: used to commit changes to a task
      branch.<span class="note">This is essentially a synonym
      for <code>git commit</code>. Developers should prefer <code>git convey
      commit</code> anyway in order to keep the habit of consistently using
      the Git-Convey tool and because future versions may want to do some
      custom house keeping at commit time.</span></li>
      <li><code>git convey finish [[&lt;task|bugfix|hotfix&gt;] &lt;task
      ID&gt;]</code>: marks the current or indicated task branch for
      integration back into the original source branch from which it was
      cut. Note that 'finished' branches may receive further commits, such as
      may be requested by the merge master, and be re-finished any number of
      times.</li>
      <li><code>git convey promote-testing</code>: archives the
      current <code>testing</code> <code>HEAD</code> and then forces
      the <code>testing</code> <code>HEAD</code> to the
      current <code>master</code> <code>HEAD</code>.</li>
      <li><code>git convey promote-release &lt;release ID&gt;</code>: cuts a
      new release branch from the
      current <code>testing</code> <code>HEAD</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    Most of the time, users will not need to concern themselves with the
    internal mechanics of the Git-Convey extensions. Developers should
    generally have a basic understanding of what's happenning in the repo
    whenever Git-Convey commands are executed, and of course Git-Convey
    developers will need to know exactly what's going on.
