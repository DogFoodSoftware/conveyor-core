    Conveyor defines a standard branching strategy which is implemented by
    Conveyor tools and used to implement Conveyor tasks. All stardard Conveyor
    projects utilize this strategy, and any Conveyor related project should
    strongly consider adopting the same strategy.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The strategy is implemented by the <a href="TODO">Convey</code> git
    extension. While every developer should understand the branching strategy,
    most developers should be able to operate exclusively through the Convey
    extensions which, when used properly, help ensure everyone stays on the
    same track.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In future Conveyor versions, the developer will interact through the
    task interface to create and manage branches and many of these details
    will hidden in the day-to-day interactions. Basic Conveyor assessments
    will still cover the branching strategy, which developers should
    understand.

    The Conveyor branching strategy makes use of two permanent
    branches: <code>master</code> and <code>testing</code>. The 
    <code>master</code> branch represents the latest collective best effort by
    development. The <code>master</code> branch <em>should</em> always be
    runnable and pass all extant tests. In practice, people make mistakes and
    at any given point in time <code>master</code> may contain errors.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Enter the <code>testing</code> branch. The <code>master</code> is
    periodically merged with <code>testing</code>, and this is the only time
    new features are introduced into <code>testing</code>. At all other times,
    changes to <code>testing</code> are exclusively bug fixes.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In other words, new features are integrated into <code>master</code>. The
    collected updates are eventually promoted to <code>testing</code>, where
    the focus is on detecting and removing bugs.
