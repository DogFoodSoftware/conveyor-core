    The Conveyor file system layout deals with two contexts: the repository
    layout and the runtime layout. The repository layout deals with the
    organizations of 'pure repo'. The 'runtime layout' deals with
    organization of projects and files in a production or development
    environment.

    The repository layot deals exclusively with the naming and organization of
    projects within a repository and does not extend itself to the contents of
    the repository, which are described in
    the <a href="#Runtime-Layout">runtime layout</a>. With a vanilla git sever
    where repositorys are just directories on some host, it is permissible to
    layout the projects in the same manner as
    a <a href="#Runtime-Projects">runtime project layout</a>. However, we want
    to Conveyor projects to be compatible with GitHub, which is rather more
    limited in it's layout options, and hence define an alternative repository
    layout.

A Conveyor project inevitably implements or supports REST-ful services and/or
an HTML5/jQuery UI. Projects are hosted in a git repository. To install and
initialize a Conveyor environment, grab the file:

http://raw.git.com/DogFoodSoftware/convey.git/bin/conveyor-install#production

(or something)

This is a shell script, which you are free to inspect, which will create the
conveyor playground and import the standard serices.
