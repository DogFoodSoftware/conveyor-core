A Conveyor project inevitably implements or supports REST-ful services and/or
an HTML5/jQuery UI. Projects are hosted in a git repository. To install and
initialize a Conveyor environment, grab the file:

http://raw.git.com/DogFoodSoftware/convey.git/bin/conveyor-install#production

(or something)

This is a shell script, which you are free to inspect, which will create the
conveyor playground and import the standard serices.
