    An 'ecosystem' is the primary soveriegn and organizational structure
    recognized in the Conveyor universe. The ecosystem is ultimately
    responsible for all policy.<span class="note">The ecosystem may delegate
    and / or allow itself to be overriden on any particular point of policy,
    it is however always the ecosystem's choice and responsibility.</span>

    'Projects' are where code is developed. An 'implementation' is where the
    code is used. In either case, the primary unit of transaction is organized
    by the project; the difference is one of use.

  <div class="p">
    Each project is owned by a single ecosystem. In general, any project may
    be forked, creating a new project, by any ecosystem&mdash;including the
    original owner. This creates multiple 'versions' of a larger 'conceptual'
    project, though we try and use the term 'project' to mean something which
    can be 'iff' equated to a specific repository (or set of mirrors). Forks
    are subject to licensing terms.

    A snapshot of a project at a particular point it time is used to
    'implement' behavior within an ecosystem. It's the same bits as one would
    see by browsing through the project code. The difference is the runtime
    vs. static dimension.
