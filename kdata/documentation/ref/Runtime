<div id="Overview" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="p">
    The Conveyor runtime is constructed from nix packages and local
    development projects. Conveyor packages themselves make use of
    the <code>~/.conveyor/runtime</code> directory to manage Conveyor
    aware projects. The Conveyor runtime is initially constructed by a
    ditribution.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="Distribution" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Distribution</div>
  <div class="p">
    The runtime is setup by the Conveyor distribution. The
    distribution is itself a Conveyor project. The distribution
    project defines the packages to use, installation logic to
    bootstrap the environment.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The standard distribution (TODO: link project) is built
    on <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix package system</a>. Nix
    has many nice features and right off the bat it imbues the
    Conveyor runtime with a high degree of portability and conformity
    across base host distributions.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Conveyor runtime components are installed via and entirely
    compatible with Nix. In the standard distribution Conveyor
    projects are mapped one-to-one with the Conveyor specific Nix
    packages defined in the distribution. The basic installer checks
    out a specific git branch / version, does whatever build is
    necessary, and links the result to the Conveyor runtime directory.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="detail" class="p">
    The distribution is primarily specified by
    the <code>conveyor-packages.nix</code> file and the contents of
    the <code>pkgs</code> directory. We point nix at
    the <code>conveyor-packages.nix</code> file. The installation for
    each project is defined in the <code>pkgs</code> directory. Note
    that the packages themselves do not typically define their own
    installation. It's the job of the distribution to set up the
    runtime, and so it is responsible for actually incorporating the
    projects. This also allows us to draw a clean line between project
    development and distribution definition.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="detail" class="p">
    It is sometimes useful to divide the Nix packages into three
    classes. The first division is between Conveyor and sub-Conveyor
    packages (mostly libraries) required to build Conveyor stack
    components. These are typically defined by Nix and imported into
    the <code>conveyor-packages.nix</code> file.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="detail" class="p">
    The second division is between 'wrapped' and 'full' Conveyor
    packages. Stack components and 3rd party libraries are often
    wrapped. This means they will have an installer in the
    distribution <code>pkgs</code> directory, but the installer is
    going to reference a non-Conveyor project. Any Conveyor specific
    configuration or modifications are stored in the distribution's
    package directory. Thus, to make a chance to the conveyor-apache
    (TODO: should be conveyor-apache-httpd) package (which wraps
    Apache HTTPD) you would work with the conveyor-distro project and
    make modifications
    under <code>~/conveyor/distro/pkgs/servers/http/conveyor-apache</code>.
    The 'full' Conveyor packages just means that the source referenced
    in the package definitions is a Conveyor project.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="coder sysops" class="p">
    The current distribution specification follows the standard
    distribution. It's entirely possible to create alternate
    distributions defining a different package set, targetting
    different hosts, and / or setting up a different runtime stack. In
    the current version we have not spent a much time separating the
    fundamental distribution specification applying to all
    distributions from the documentation and specification specifit to
    the standard distribution.

  <div class="blurbTitle">Project Layout</div>
  <div class="p">
    All project files are organized within a single project home
    directory. The project exist entirely within the Conveyor playground. The
    playground location is specified when the conveyor core is installed. The
    default value is <code>$HOME/playground</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Within this playground, each project declares the location of it's home
    directory. All operatings dealing with the project must make no assumption
    regarding the location of the project home directory within the
    playground. However, we do require public projects to conform to certain
    conventions to be considered Conveyor compliant.
  </div>
  <div id="Organization-Namespaces" class="subHeader"><span>Organization Namespaces</span></code>
  <div class="p">
    Within the playground, each project should be rooted in a directory named
    after an root internet domain owned by the organization / individual
    owning the project. E.g., the core Conveyor development is done by Dog
    Food Software, LLC and organized under the
    directory <code>dogfoodsoftware.com<code>. Private projects need need not
    follow this convention.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The namespace owners are free to organize projects within this namespace
    any way they see fit. Projects may be organized into groups, sub-groups,
    etc. Some or all projects may be placed directly under the organization's
    root directory.

  <div class="blurbTitle">Intra-Project Files</div>
  <div class="p">
    Within each project, Conveyor mandates compliance to the following tree:
    <ul>
      <li><code>bin/</code>: executable (binaries and scripts) specific to the
	project. These files are updated exclusively by task changes.</li>
      <li><code>conf/</code>: configuration files for Conveyor and other
	Conveyor projects. These files are update exclusively by tasks
	changes.<span data-perspective="detailed"> Some projects, however, may
	maintain runtime configuration files under the <code>/data</code>
	directory.</li>
      <li><code>data/</code>: contains runtime dynamic data, such as database
	files. This directory is always ignored by the git repo. The contents
	are generally updated by runtime logic. Updates may come in through
	task changesas well, these mostly representing structural/model
	changes.</li>
      <li><code>static-data/</code>: contains (relatively) static data, like
	documentation pages. These files are updated exclusively through task
	changes.</li>
      <li><code>static-media/</code>: contains (relatively) static media
	resources which may directly accessed and served by the HTTP
	server. E.g., images, video, etc. Smaller files may be included
	directly, and larger files are generally included by reference to an
	external directory. E.g., as a symlink. These files are updated
	exclusively by task changes.</li>
      <li><code>runnable/</code>: contains the runtime-ready files. In many
	cases&mdash;as with PHP projects&mdash;<code>runnable</code> is a
	sym-link to the <code>src/</code> directory. In this
	case, <code>runnable</code> is included in the git repo. In casess
	where the project src does need to be compiled, <code>runnable</code>
	is generated at install time and ignored by git. These files are
	updated exclusively through task changes.</li>
      <li><code>src/</code>: this is where all source / code files live. These
	files are updated exclusively by task changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Dynamic vs. Static Bits</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Generally, only the <code>/data</code> directory is updated directly by
    the runtime. All other files / data is updated by 'task changes'. This
    means the bits are tracked by git and updated on task branches which are
    then merged into the published branches (both development and
    production). When changes are pulled in for the branches, this triggers
    updates in the data as the task changes are incorporated.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="future" class="p">
    To complicate things a bit, future Conveyor runtime will support
    seamlessly creating and merging task changes through the runtime. This
    means that operations like content management,
    effecting <code>static-resources</code> and <code>static-data/</code> for
    instance, may be made through the Conveyor front end. In this case, the
    change is facilitated through runtime logic, and also still exclusively
    accomplished within the context of a task change.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Directory Sub-Divisions</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    <ul>
      <li><code>bin/</code>: should contain all scripts directly. Library
	components will be stored under <code>src/lib</code> and accessed
	through <code>runnable/lib</code>.</li>
      <li><code>conf/</code>: should contain all configuration files directly
	unless things get crowded (+/-20 files). Projects may also subdivided
	to respect project requirements.</li>
      <li><code>data/</code>: contents are entirely defined by the
	project. Further details and recommendations discussed under
	the <a href="#Portability-and-Coherence-Guidelines">portability and
	  coherence guidelines</a>.</li>
      <li><code>static-data/</code>: as with <code>data/</code>, contents are
	defined on a per-project basis though we do
	provide <a href="#Portability-and-Coherence-Guidelines">portability
	and coherence guidelines</a>.</li>
      <li><code>static-media/</code>: typically broken out by 'kind'. At the
	moment, there is not a lot of regulation on how this is laid out and
	projects should consider all 'static-media' contents in all projects
	to exist within a single global namespace served.</li>
      <li><code>runnable/</code>: in many cases, this is just a symlink
      to <code>src/</code>. For projects with 'built' services, this will
      contain the built service binaries and should be segregated by
      such. There is currently no allowance for projects that contain both
      library / source code and built projects.</li>
      <li><code>src/</code>: this is typically divided into one or
      more <code>lib/<code>, <code>rest/</code>, <code>site/<code> and
      /or <code>ui/<code> directories.</li>

<div id="Portability-and-Coherence-Guidelines" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle"><span>Portability and Coherence Guidelines</div>
  <div class="p">
    These guidelines are intended to help developers create and manage
    projects so they may be cleanly updated, backed up, restored, installed,
    and deleted largely independent of one another. The section consists
    mostly of recommendations rather than requirements. 
 </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Segregate Data by Project</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Both dynamic and static data should generally be segragated by the
    'consumer' project. Particularly, the <code>data/</code>
    and <code>static-data</code> directories ideally contain sub-directories
    named after projects. The files within those directories are ultimately
    consumed / managed by code living within the named project.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    This means that you will often find a <code>data/foo</code> directory in
    the 'foo' project runtime layout. These are referred to as 'project data
    directories'. Other common breakouts in the current release
    include <code>postgres/</code> and <code>kwiki/</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    It is common for these files to 'live' under the project hosting the
    service which creates / manages the files and referenced from related
    locations. For instance, you might
    have <code>~/postgres/data/postgres/db</code> where the DB bits are stored
    (hard links) and <code>~/foo/data/foo/postgres/db</code> as symlink to the
    postgres directory.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In other instances, as with kwiki&mdash;where data can be easily /
    naturally distributed&mdash;you will find data consumed by project A
    living under project B's <code>data/</code> directory. For instance, kwiki
    documentation would live
    under <code>~/foo/static-data/kwiki/documentation</code>. In this case,
    'foo' is the data creator / manager and 'kwiki' is conceptually a strict
    consumer. This distinction is often driven by operational realities. In
    practice, <code>data/<code> files tend to be concentrated and refenced by
    distributed projects while <code>static-data/<code> tends to live under
    distributed projects. Distributed data is not generally referenced by the
    consumer in the file system.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Logs and Runtime Configuration</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Within the project data directories under <code>data/</code>, it's
    considered polite to use <code>logs/<code> and <code>ext-conf/<code> for
    log files and generated / runtime configuration files respectively. Each
    of these directories may be further subdivided as convenience /
    necessary. Developers should not rely on runtime configuration or logs to
    be located here as it may not always be possible.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Log files generally live in the project providing the service which
    atually generates the log files. So, postgres logs would be found
    under <code>~/postgres/data/postgres/logs</code>. When appropriate,
    projects should create symbolic links to these canonical files;
    i.e. <code>~/foo/data/foo/logs/postgres-logs<code>.
