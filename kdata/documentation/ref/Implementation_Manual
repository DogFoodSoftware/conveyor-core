    Creating a resource demo involves sketching in the
    resource <code>GET</code> request handlers, which generate the HTML that
    defines resource user interface. This involves inserting HTML code into
    the service request handler and primarily requires knowledge of UI
    convetion and HTML+CSS. Novel interface may require a UI designer as well.

    The assignee should first check that the resource directory exists in the
    within the local project repository. Unless specific instructions are
    provided, the assignee should
    copy <a href="/documentation/conveyor/ref/code-templates/php-get-services.php"><code>~/conveyor/kdata/documentation/ref/code-templates/php-get-services.php</code></a>

    HTML coders for whom that sounds like a daunting task may bounce the

    If a file is derived from a template, it should make reference to the
    template from which it is derived. The reference should include the URL
    for the repository and the 'last update reference' for the
    template. <span class="spec-assertion">The 'last update
    reference' <em>must</em> be noted where conveniant near the top of a
    template file following the form:

    Installed software is managed at the project level. Inter-project
    dependencies are therefore specified via reference to specific project
    version. The subscription file is one of the few bits of code which is
    changed in downstream branches without the changes being merged. In other
    words, dependencies are explicitly managed on a per-branch basis.

    Branch versions are used to 'subscribe' to a particular project
    branch. Projects will typically want to subscribe to

- Version specific repo references are better than idiomatic version
  specifications.
- Branch specific repo references provide a simple method of reliable update
  management.
