    One need not be a professional writer to have heard the maxim "know your
    audience". While sage advice, it brings up a problem: what if you have
    many audiences? What if you need to address salespeople, developers, and
    management? In this case the traditional choice is either a single
    document satisfying no one or three independent documents, complex to
    maintain and tedious in their length.

  <div class="p">
    Adaptive documentation is a technique enabling a authors to write a single
    document which adapts itself to the readers stated perspective. Authors
    annotate their documentation with perspectives. The authors may address
    each audience particularly, eliminating the need to try and write for
    everyone at once. The authors simultaneously maint a single document with
    and may naturally address all or multiple audiences.
