    Departments and roles are useful for dividing up the creation and
    assignment of tasks. A <code>/tasks</code> item must assert a role,
    department, or both a role and department to which the task should be
    assigned.

    Departments organize related worker and tasks within a project. Here we
    lay out a specific departmental structure, the Standard Conveyor
    Departments. This particular departmental structure is not essential to
    Conveyor, but is proposed as a general purpose breakdown that's both
    sufficient and natural for many projects. Future Conveyor versions will
    likely do something different with this section, possibly removing it to a
    loadable module and tweaking the department definitions. We plan to
    maintain the 'Standard Conveyor Departments' in some form.

    The 'vision' department is responsible for the highest level decisions

    structure of the organization.
