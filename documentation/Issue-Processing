Issue management and planning is primarily done with:

- availability,
- project phase,
- skill set, and
- project component.

The current availble issues may also be ordered within each project phase
according to priority. 'Priority' is, however, considered a secondary
attribute.

Issue planners deal with the whole set of issues, making sure issue are filly
defined and correctly reference other issues. Developers, system admins,
technical writers and other issues consumers pick off the available issues
according to their skill set, phase, and priority.
